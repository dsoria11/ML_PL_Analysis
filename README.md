# Machine Learning Assisted Prediction for Quantum Well Photoluminescence Growth
A machine learning (ML) model used to look at photoluminescence (PL) data from our InGaAs quantum wells. This model will provide insight on future quantum wells grown by using a supervised learning agent.

## Introduction
This is a small project that extracts the peak photoluminescense (PL) and intensity out of a previously measured Quantum Well sample. Then, using a machine learning model, you can analyze this with other relevant input parameters to predict peak PL measurements for future Quantum Wells grown.

## Dependencies 
This project uses three main libraries: `RandomForestRegressor`, `GradientBoostingRegressor`, and `MultiOutputRegressor`.
